# Problem 2: Finding Good Few-Shot Examples is Hard

## ❌ The Problem

Traditional few-shot learning requires:
- Manual selection of examples
- No metrics to measure effectiveness
- Time-consuming trial and error
- Not scalable
- Model-specific examples

## ✅ DSPy Solution

DSPy automatically:
- Finds best examples through optimization
- Uses metrics to guide selection
- Tests many combinations efficiently
- Adapts to different models

## 🧪 Test It

```bash
python traditional_approach.py
python dspy_solution.py
python test_with_framework.py
```
