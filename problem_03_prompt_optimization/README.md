# Problem 3: Prompt Optimization is Manual and Slow

## ❌ The Problem

Traditional prompt optimization:
- Manual iteration through variations
- No systematic search
- Slow and expensive
- Might miss better solutions

## ✅ DSPy Solution

DSPy provides:
- Automatic optimization (MIPRO, COPRO, BootstrapFewShot)
- Systematic search strategies
- Efficient optimization
- Finds better solutions

## 🧪 Test It

```bash
python traditional_approach.py
python dspy_solution.py
```
