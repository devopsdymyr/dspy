# Problem 5: Complex Pipelines are Hard to Build and Optimize

## ❌ The Problem

Traditional pipeline building:
- Manual composition
- Hard to optimize
- No modularity
- Testing complexity

## ✅ DSPy Solution

DSPy provides:
- Modular, composable building blocks
- Optimizable entire pipeline
- Declarative structure
- Testable as a unit

## 🧪 Test It

```bash
python traditional_approach.py
python dspy_solution.py
```
